# Back Button

<!-- @todo Add demo image/video for all platforms. -->

Back button is simply a button displayed in the header of the Mini App.

You can:

- show and hide the button;
- handle button click.

Clicking the back button triggers a click event and doesn't have any default behavior, therefore it's up to you to decide what to do when the button is clicked.

<!-- @todo In all clients? -->
In many Telegram clients, the back button is shown **instead of the close button**, which can make it harder for the user to close the Mini App. Keep this in mind when designing your Mini App.
