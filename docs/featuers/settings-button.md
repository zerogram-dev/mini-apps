# Settings Button

<!-- @todo Add demo image/video for all platforms. -->

Settings button is a button displayed in the submenu of the Mini App header.

You can:

- show and hide the button;
- handle button click.

Clicking the settings button triggers a click event and doesn't have any default behavior, therefore it's up to you to decide what to do when the button is clicked.
